Given a set of resistors, find the combination closest to the desired value.

Result is a closest value and combination used to acheive it. E.g.
        100 + 330 | 220 + 1000 = 1146
means you should connect 100 and 300 in series which gives a value of 400. Then you should connect 220 in parralel to 400, etc.

If the desired value is not provided, all possibilities are printed out.
